INTRODUCTION - Hello, Myself Umang Goel.I am currently pursuing BE CSE at Bits Goa in my first year

Here's a chronological order of how my problems and learning went while completing this project

1. Learned what API was and how to use it

2. Tried to do the project in c++ but was not possible

3. Read groq documentations given online for better understanding

4. Learnt basics of python for project and downloaded python from Homebrew

5. Setup python so that vscode could compile the code

6. ERROR- vscode was calling python instead of python3 so I alias python to python3

7. ERROR - Externally-managed-environment -- command pip3 install groq was showing this error as groq module was not in homebrew. So i deleted homebrew and reinstalled python from their website

8. Installed groq but vscode couldn't find it so i reinstalled groq at a targeted location where vscode checks

9. ERROR- No module named 'pydantic_core._pydantic_core' was showing in VScode. Tried a lot but couldn't find solution so switched to Pycharm

10. Read File handling in python and how to read and write in json files
